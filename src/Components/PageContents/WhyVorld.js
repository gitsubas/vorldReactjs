                    Vorld is a virtual environment or metaverse made up of different kingdoms, playgrounds, 
                    and tokenomics owned and designed by the community. In vorld, players can collaborate to 
                    build virtual worlds and games, with no central authority while keeping the true ownership 
                    of their assets as non fungible tokens (NFTS).
